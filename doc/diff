   Differences to Standard PicoLisp
   =================================

Features
   No bignums (only 30- or 62-bit integers)
   No external symbols / database
   No unicode support (only ASCII subset)
   No binary I/O, family IPC, and networking
   No console line editing

Semantics
   'heap' and 'gc' in kB instead of MB


Additional diffs
1. Function pointers are not directly stored in the cell. Instead, there is a Functions array and the cell actually contains the index into the array. This is done because some C compilers dont guarantee that function pointers are aligned.
